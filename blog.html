                        <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold text-primary">var keyword in JavaScript:</span> The
                            var is the
                            oldest keyword to
                            declare a
                            variable in JavaScript.

                            Scope: Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or
                            function scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally,
                            and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function.
                            Variable is declared globally. So, the scope of the variable is global, and it can be
                            accessible everywhere in the program
                            <br>
                            <span class="fw-bold text-primary">let keyword in JavaScript:</span> The let keyword is an
                            improved
                            version of the var keyword & user can update it value.

                            Scope: block scoped: The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It cant be
                            accessible outside the particular block ({block}).
                            <br>
                            <span class="fw-bold text-primary">const keyword in JavaScript:</span> The const keyword has
                            all the
                            properties that are the same as
                            the let keyword, except the user cannot update it.

                            Scope: block scoped: When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it,
                            otherwise, it returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is
                            declared.

                        <p class="card-text">1. A single set of back ticks (` `) to enclose the entire line. <br>
                            2. Direct interpolation of a variable, in place in the string. <br>
                            3. The ability to write multiple lines in a single string. <br><br>

                            <span class="fw-bold text-primary">Apart from that there are other considerations.</span>
                            <br>
                            * No need to use standard quotes anywhere in the script. Back ticks can be used on all
                            strings
                            (with few possible exceptions). <br>
                            * Since the interpolation accepts all expressions, we can use template literals within the {
                            }'s.

                            Functions</h5>
                        <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold text-primary">Following are the main
                                differences:</span>
                            1. Syntax
                            2. Arguments binding
                            3. Use of this keyword
                            4. Using a new keyword
                            5. No duplicate named parameters <br>
                            <span class="text-primary fw-bold">1) Syntax:</span> <br>
                            A developer can get the same result as regular functions by writing a few lines of code
                            using arrow functions. Curly brackets are not required if only one expression is present.
                            If arrow function only one argument, then the parentheses are not required
                            <br>
                            <span class="text-primary fw-bold">2) Arguments binding</span> <br>
                            Arrow functions do not have arguments binding.
                            <br>
                            <span class="text-primary fw-bold">3) Use of this keyword</span> <br>
                            unlike Regular functions, arrow function does not have their own "this" keyword.
                            <br>
                            <span class="text-primary fw-bold">4) Using a new keyword</span> <br>
                            Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and
                            callable. Regular functions are constructible; they can be called using the new keyword.
                            <br>
                            However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow functions
                            can never be used as constructor functions.
                            <br>
                            <span class="text-primary fw-bold">5) No duplicate named parameters</span> <br>
                            Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether in strict or non-strict
                            mode.
                            <br>
                            However, We can use duplicate named parameters for regular function in non-strict mode.
